# Spotitube
This is the client repository for the Spotitube project.  This project uses a custom Webpack 2 build, React, Redux, SASS and Jest for testing.

Spotitube is a mashup of the Spotify and YouTube APIs. The app will go through authentication flows for both services and then load your twenty most recent Spotify playlists. Select a playlist, the track listing loads. Select a track, a YouTube clip for that track is then loaded.
